# honestMLcoding 👋

**Honest machine learning + honest coding, in plain English.**

Most tutorials skip the parts beginners actually get stuck on:
SSH vs SCP, environments, dependency hell, broken docs, cloud GPUs, “why did this crash?” debugging, and how to tell if results are real or just leakage.

### What we do
- **YouTube Shorts (≈60s):** get a project running *fast*
- **Long video (≈5–8 min):** explain *step-by-step*, from zero assumptions
- **GitHub repos:** copy/pasteable code you can run to validate your learning

### What “honest” means here
- No hype. No “just trust me.”
- No exploitation framing.
- We teach reproducible workflows: data splits, evaluation, debugging, and responsible use.

## Start here (projects)

### ML (education-first, reproducible)
- **MLCancerDiagnostics** — tabular classification training example.  
  Educational only. Not a medical device.  
  Source: https://github.com/honestmlcoding/MLCancerDiagnostics

- **lotteryml** — a clean ML harness for studying randomness / bias / leakage / evaluation.  
  Not “beating the lottery.”  
  Source: https://github.com/honestmlcoding/lotteryml

### Systems / C++ (touch multiple domains, safely)
- **vanitypubkey** — public-key-only EC point ops (learning project).

## How to use these repos
Each repo aims to include:
- a **1-minute quickstart**
- a **“What you’ll learn”** section
- common failure modes + fixes
